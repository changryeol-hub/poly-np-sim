Academic and Research Use Notice:

This software and associated scripts are released for purely academic and research purposes, 
primarily to enable verification, reproduction, and exploration of the results presented 
in the accompanying P=NP proof and implementation study.

The implementation is intended for experimental validation and educational use, 
and is not yet optimized for practical SAT/Subset-Sum solving or commercial applications.

By releasing this code, the authors aim to support transparency, peer verification, 
and further research in computational complexity and Turing Machine simulations.
